- Generate synthetic data from database (using synthpop? Must be able to generate timeseries data)
- In generated data, add a column for medication
- Randomly set a few (consecutive) rows to 1 (= is taking medication)
- For next BP values, lowers it by the value defined for the medication (wait for time elapsed > time to kick in (between 2 and 4 weeks))
- When it stops, stop this lowering after XX weeks (between 2 and 4)
