Add age (currently set to 60 as a baseline value) -> later, should find studies with informations 

Describe what do we want (i.e. "we want this data in the end")
What do we do with the data (i.e. how do we generate it)
Talk about SDV and what we will add in it later (age, weight, etc. -> add indicators from the literature)
